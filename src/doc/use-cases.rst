    end
  
1. Checks

   When a request is submitted, the CR may run checks against the data available in the PR using:

   - ``matchPersonAttributes``: to check the exactitude of the parents' attributes as known in the PR
   - ``getPersonAttributes``: to get missing data about the parents's identity
   - ``getPersonUIN``: to check if the new born is already known to PR or not

   How the CR will process the request in case of data discrepancy is specific to each CR implementation
   and not in the scope of this document.

2. Creation

   The birth is registered in the CR. The first step after the checks is to generate a new UIN
   a call to ``createUIN``.
    
3. Notification

   As part of the birth registration, it is the responsibility of the CR to notify other systems, including the PR,
   of this event using:
   
   - ``notify``: to send a *birth* along with the new ``UIN``.
   
   The PR, upon reception of the birth event, will update the identity registry with this new identity using:
    
   - ``getPersonAttributes``: to get the attributes of interest to the PR for the parents and the new child.

Deduplication
"""""""""""""

During the lifetime of a registry, it is possible that duplicates are detected. This can happen for instance
after the addition of biometrics in the system. When a registry considers that two records are actually the same
and decides to merge them, a notification must be sent.

    activate CR
    activate PR
    CR -> CR: merge()
    deactivate PR
    note right: merge/register duplicate
    deactivate CR
  
How the target of the notification should react is specific to each subsystem.
