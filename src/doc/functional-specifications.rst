
Functional Specifications
-------------------------


This chapter describes the following group of services.

- UIN management. This service can be implemented by PR, by CR or by another system. We will consider it is provided
  by a system called *UIN Generator*.
- Notifications. When data is changed, a notification is sent and received by systems that registered for
  this type of events. For instance, PR can register for the events *birth* emitted by CR.
- Data access. A set of services to access data.
- Usage. Identity based services implemented on top of Identity system mainly *Identity Verification* and
  *Identity Attribute* sharing.

The design is based on the following assumptions:

#. All persons recorded in CR have a :term:`UIN`. The UIN can be used as a key to access person data for all records.
#. All persons recorded in PR have a UIN. The UIN can be used as a key to access person data for all records.
#. The CR and PR are both considered as centralized systems that are connected. If CR is architectured in a
   decentralized way, and it is often the case, one of its component must be centralized, connected to the network,
   and in charge of the exchanges with PR.
#. Since all instances of CR and PR are customized for each business needs, dictionaries must be explicitly
   defined to describe the attributes, the event types, and the document types. See :ref:`technical-specifications`
   for the mandatory elements of those dictionaries.
#. The relationship parent/child is not mandatory in PR. A PR implementation may manage this relationship
   or may ignore it and rely on CR to manage it.
#. All persons are stored in PR. There is no record in CR that is not also in PR.
#. The interface does not expose biometric services. Usage of biometrics is optional and is described in other
   standards already defined.

.. note:: Synchronous and Asynchronous Processing

    Some services can be very slow depending on the algorithm used, the system workload, etc.
    Services are described so that:

    - If possible, the answer is provided synchronously in the response of the service.
    - If not possible for some reason, a status *PENDING* is returned and the answer, when available, is
      pushed to a callback provided by the client.

    If no callback is provided, this indicates that the client wants a synchronous answer, whatever the time it takes.

    If a callback is provided, the server will decide if the processing is done synchronously or asynchronously.

  :todo:`add sequence diagrams`

..  admonition:: Principles

    - Support only multi-encounter model
    - Do not expose templates (only images) for CRUD services
    - Focus on simple essential services (CRUD, identify, verify)
    - Images can be passed by value or reference
    - Image format: ISO-19794

    * - Name
      - Description

    * - ``transactionID``
      - A string provided by the client application to identity the request being submitted.
        It is optional in most cases. When provided, it can be used for tracing and debugging.
        It is mandatory for asynchronous services and is included in the response pushed asynchronously.
    * - ``priority``
      - Priority of the request. Values range from 0 to 9
    * - ``maxNbCand``
      - The maximum number of candidates to return.
    * - ``threshold``
      - The threshold to apply on the score to filter the candidates during an identification,
        authentication or verification.
    * - ``algorithm``
      - Specify the type of algorithm to be used.
    * - ``accuracyLevel``
      - Specify the accuracy expected of the request. This is to support different use cases, when
        different behavior of the ABIS is expected (response time, accuracy, consolidation/fusion, etc.).

    * - Type

    * - Gallery
      - A group of subjects related by a common purpose, designation, or status.
        A subject can belong to multiple galleries.
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Subject
      - Person who is known to an identity assurance system.
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Encounter
      - Event in which the client application interacts with a subject resulting in data being
        collected during or about the encounter. An encounter is characterized by an *identifier* and a *type*
        (also called *purpose* in some context).
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Biographic Data
      - a dictionary (list of names and values) giving the biographic data of interest for the biometric services.
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Filters
      - a dictionary (list of names and values or *range* of values) describing the filters during a search.
        Filters can apply on biographic data, contextual data or encounter type.
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Biometric Data
      - Digital representation of biometric characteristics.
        As an example, a record containing the image of a finger is a biometric data.
        All images can be passed by value (image buffer is in the request) or by reference (the address of the
        image is in the request).
        All images are compliant with ISO 19794. ISO 19794 allows multiple encoding and supports additional
        metadata specific to fingerprint, palmprint, portrait or iris.
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - Candidate
      - Information about a candidate found during an identification
      - :todo:`TBD`

    * - CandidateScore
      - Detailed information about a candidate found during an identification. It includes
        the score for the biometrics used.
