Functional Specifications
-------------------------


This chapter describes in pseudo code the following group of services.

- UIN management. This service can be implemented by PR, by CR or by another system. We will consider it is provided
  by a system called *UIN Generator*.
- Notifications. When data is changed, a notification is sent and received by systems that registered for
  this type of events. For instance, PR can register for the events *birth* emitted by CR.
- Data access. A set of services to access data.

The design is based on the following assumptions:

#. All persons recorded in CR have a :term:`UIN`. The UIN can be used as a key to access person data for all records.
#. All persons recorded in PR have a UIN. The UIN can be used as a key to access person data for all records.
#. The CR and PR are both considered as centralized systems that are connected. If CR is architectured in a
   decentralized way, and it is often the case, one of its component must be centralized, connected to the network,
   and in charge of the exchanges with PR.
#. Since all instances of CR and PR are customized for each business needs, dictionaries must be explicitly
   defined to describe the attributes, the event types, and the document types. See :ref:`technical-specifications`
   for the mandatory elements of those dictionaries.
#. The relationship parent/child is not mandatory in PR. A PR implementation may manage this relationship
   or may ignore it and rely on CR to manage it.
#. All persons are stored in PR. There is no record in CR that is not also in PR.
#. The interface does not expose biometric services. Usage of biometrics is optional and is described in other
   standards already defined.

UIN Management

Services
''''''''

.. py:function:: createUIN(attributes)

   Generate a new UIN.

   :param list[(str,str)] attributes: A list of pair (attribute name, value) that can be used to allocate a new UIN
   :return: a new UIN or an error if the generation is not possible

This service is synchronous.

Notifications
"""""""""""""

Services
''''''''

.. py:function:: notify(type,UIN)

   Notify of a new event all systems that subscribed to this event

   :param str type: Event type
   :param list[str] UIN: Records affected by the event
   :return: N/A

This service is asynchronous.

    note over CR,PR: PR can notify CR of new events
    PR ->> CR: notify(type,[UIN])

.. note::

    Notifications are possible after the receiver has subscribed to an event.

Data Access
"""""""""""

Services
''''''''

.. py:function:: getPersonAttributes(UIN, names)

   Retrieve person attributes.

   :param str UIN: The person's UIN
   :param list[str] names: The names of the attributes requested
   :return: a list of pair (name,value). In case of error (unknown attributes, unauthorized access, etc.) the value is replaced with an error

This service is synchronous. It can be used to retrieve attributes from CR or from PR.

-------

.. py:function:: matchPersonAttributes(UIN, attributes)

    Match person attributes. This service is used to check the value of attributes without exposing private data
    
    :param str UIN: The person's UIN
    :param list[(str,str)] attributes: The attributes to match. Each attribute is described with its name and the expected value
    :return: If all attributes match, a *Yes* is returned. If one attribute does not match, a *No* is returned along with a list of (name,reason) for each non-matching attribute.
