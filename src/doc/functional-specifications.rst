Functional Specifications
-------------------------


This chapter describes in pseudo code the following group of services.

- UIN management. This service can be implemented by PR, by CR or by another system. We will consider it is provided
  by a system called *UIN Generator*.
- Notifications. When data is changed, a notification is sent and received by systems that registered for
  this type of events. For instance, PR can register for the events *birth* emitted by CR.
- Data access. A set of services to access data.

The design is based on the following assumptions:

#. All persons recorded in CR have a :term:`UIN`. The UIN can be used as a key to access person data for all records.
#. All persons recorded in PR have a UIN. The UIN can be used as a key to access person data for all records.
#. The CR and PR are both considered as centralized systems that are connected. If CR is architectured in a
   decentralized way, and it is often the case, one of its component must be centralized, connected to the network,
   and in charge of the exchanges with PR.
#. Since all instances of CR and PR are customized for each business needs, dictionaries must be explicitly
   defined to describe the attributes, the event types, and the document types. See :ref:`technical-specifications`
   for the mandatory elements of those dictionaries.
#. The relationship parent/child is not mandatory in PR. A PR implementation may manage this relationship
   or may ignore it and rely on CR to manage it.
#. All persons are stored in PR. There is no record in CR that is not also in PR.
#. The interface does not expose biometric services. Usage of biometrics is optional and is described in other
   standards already defined.

Biometrics
""""""""""

..  admonition:: Principles (to be reviewed)

    - Implement as much as possible synchronous services
    - Support only multi-encounter model
    - Do not expose templates (only images) for CRUD services
    - Focus on simple essential services (CRUD, identify, verify)
    - Images can be passed by value or reference
    - Image format: ISO-19794

Services

----------

.. py:function:: identify(galleryID, data, callback, options)

    Identify a subject using biometrics data and filters on biographic data. This may include multiple
    operations, including manual operations. This service is **asynchronous**.

    :param str galleryID: Search only in this gallery.
    :param data: The input data (filters and biometric data)
    :param callback: The address of a service to be called when the result is available.
    :param dict options: the processing options. Supported options are ``transactionID``, ``priority``,

    :header-rows: 1

    * - Name
      - Description

    * - ``transactionID``
      - A string provided by the client application to identity the request being submitted.
        It is optional in most cases. When provided, it can be used for tracing and debugging.
        It is mandatory for asynchronous services and is included in the response pushed asynchronously.
    * - ``priority``
      - Priority of the request. Values range from 0 to 9
    * - ``maxNbCand``
      - The maximum number of candidates to return.
    * - ``threshold``
      - The threshold to apply on the score to filter the candidates during an identification,
        authentication or verification.
    * - ``algorithm``
      - Specify the type of algorithm to be used. Some matching engine may include multiple algorithms
        to support different use cases (response time, accuracy, consolidation/fusion, etc.).

Data Model
''''''''''

.. list-table:: Biometric Data Model
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 25 75

    * - Type
      - Description

    * - Gallery
      - A group of subjects related by a common purpose, designation, or status.
        A subject can belong to multiple galleries.

    * - Subject
      - Person who is known to an identity assurance system.

    * - Encounter
      - Event in which the client application interacts with a subject resulting in data being
        collected during or about the encounter.

    * - Filters
      - a dictionary (list of names and values) of the biographic data of interest for the biometric services.

    * - Search Filters
      - a dictionary (list of names and range of values) of the biographic data used during a search. This differs from a
        filter because it may include ranges instead of a single value.

    * - Biometric Data
      - Digital representation of biometric characteristics.
        As an example, a record containing the image of a finger is a biometric data.
        All images can be passed by value (image buffer is in the request) or by reference (the address of the
        image is in the request).
        All images are compliant with ISO 19794. ISO 19794 allows multiple encoding and supports additional
        metadata specific to fingerprint, palmprint, portrait or iris.

    * - Candidate
      - Information about a candidate found during an identification

    * - CandidateScore
      - Detailed information about a candidate found during an identification. It includes
        the score for the biometrics used.
