OSIA Versions & Referencing
===========================

There will be a version for each interface, see table below. 
Each interface can be referenced in tenders as follows:

    ``OSIA - [interface name] v. [version number]``

For instance below is the string to reference the *Notification*'* interface:

    ``OSIA – Notification v. 1.0``

This document proposes a set of interfaces that could be used by each component (non-prescriptive). 
As a consequence, it is possible to reference directly that set of interfaces bundled with a given component. 
It is possible to reference the bundle of these interfaces as follows:

    ``OSIA – [component name] v. [version number]``

For instance for Civil Registry (CR) OSIA proposes the following set of interfaces: 

- notification
- data access

Below is the string to reference this set of interfaces linked to CR:

    ``OSIA – CR v. 1.0``
