OSIA Versions & Referencing
===========================

There will be a version for each interface.
Each interface can be referenced in tenders as follows:

    ``OSIA - [interface name] v. [version number]``

For instance below is the string to reference the *Notification* interface:

    ``OSIA - Notification v. 1.0.0``

Below is the complete list of available interfaces with related version to date:

- OSIA - Notification - v. |release|
- OSIA - Data Access - v. |release|
- OSIA - UIN Management - v. |release|
- OSIA - Enrollment Services - v. |release|
- OSIA - Identity Management - v. |release|
- OSIA - Population Registry Services - v. |release|
- OSIA - Biometrics - v. |release|
- OSIA - Credential Services - v. |release|
- OSIA - ID Usage - v. |release|

This document proposes as well a set of interfaces that could be used by each component (non-prescriptive).

As a consequence, it is possible to reference directly that set of interfaces bundled with a given component. 
It is possible to reference the bundle of these interfaces as follows:

    ``OSIA – [component name] v. [version number]``

For instance for Civil Registry (CR) OSIA proposes the following set of interfaces:

- OSIA - Notifications - v. |release|
- OSIA - Data Access - v. |release|

Below is the string to reference this set of interfaces linked to CR:

    OSIA – CR v. |release|
